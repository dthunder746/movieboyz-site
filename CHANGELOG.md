# Changelog

## 24 Feb 2026

### New Features

**Click table rows to plot movies on the chart**
Select any movie in the table to see its profit line on the chart. Select multiple movies to compare them side by side. A "Clear selection" button appears above the table while rows are selected. The chart heading updates to show which movie(s) you're viewing. Changing the owner filter automatically clears the movie selection.

**Click leaderboard cards to explore an owner's movies**
Click any owner card in the leaderboard to filter the table to their movies and switch the chart to show each of their movies as a separate profit line. Click the same card again to return to the full view. The owner filter buttons below the chart work independently and support multi-select — click multiple owners to compare them.

**Chart zoom and pan**
Scroll the mouse wheel over the chart to zoom in on a time range. On mobile, use a two-finger pinch gesture. Click and drag to pan left or right. A "Reset zoom" button above the chart restores the full view.

### Improvements

**Latest dates shown first in the table**
The Daily Gross and Weekly Gross columns are now ordered with the most recent date on the left, so you see the newest numbers without scrolling right.

**Chart tooltip sorted by profit**
When hovering over the chart, owners are listed from highest to lowest profit at that point in time — no more scanning to find who's on top.

**Column headers no longer truncated**
Detail column headers now size to fit their content. "To Date Gross" and "To Date Profit" renamed to "Gross TD" and "Profit TD" for brevity.

**Mobile table scrolling fixed**
On touchscreens, swiping left/right on the table now scrolls as expected instead of accidentally triggering column resize.
